Week 1
This week, I used AI to refresh my knowledge of python by asking ChatGPT how to execute certain functions and generate sample code that I could use for learning the syntax of the code I needed to do.

Week 2
This week, I used ChatGPT to help explain to me the concepts of things such as loops and boolean code, since my knowledge from last semester was a bit rusty to say the least.

Week 3
This week, I used ChatGPT once more to help me understand concepts in my course where I am learning SQL. I learned how to use many commands such as CONCAT and SUBSTRING.

Week 4
This week, I used ChatGPT to study, asking it to explain concepts and provide definitions for terms. I also played around with the prompts I used, ensuring they were detailed and relied on real world information only.

Week 5
This week, I used ChatGPT to debug code in my courses covering Python and R. Python was able to pick out small syntax errors and make suggestions.

Week 6
This week, I used ChatGPT to clarify the concept of classes to me and teach me the syntax of creating classes. It was really useful because I was able to ask the AI to tailor its response in a way I could understand.
